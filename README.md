### Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
1. Data Collection: Identify and gather data sources, such as public sources, csv files and APIs. Then extract and clean the data.
2. Data Analysis: Explore and visualise the data to identify patterns and trends (produce 6–8 visualizations of data). Conduct statistical analyses such as finding mean, median and etc, to answer the research questions.
3. Location Analysis: Research and analyse different areas and boroughs in London and create matplotlib map.
4. Presentation: Create a presentation (on Powerpoint) summarising the findings and insights. Could create extra slides for appendix for more information.
